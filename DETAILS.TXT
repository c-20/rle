implements run length encoding
60KB output files, 250ms compression vs 1.2s for PNG on ARM
further improvement possible by remapping FF00FFFF to EE
 and EE to CCEE and CC to CCCC (CC expects extra byte CC or EE

CCEE is EE
CCCCEE is CCFF00FFFF
CCCCCC is CC and a missing clarity byte (expect CC or EE)!
CCCCCCEE is CCEE
CCCCCCEEEE is CCEEFF00FFFF
CCCCCCEEEEEE is CCEEFF00FFFFFF00FFFF

TODO!
